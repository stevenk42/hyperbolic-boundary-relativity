# A Mathematical Gem: The Hyperbolic Boundary is Not at Infinity --- It's a Relativistic Shadow
a physically intuitive interpretation of the hyperbolic boundary — long implicit in the hyperboloid model but absent from pedagogy — using special relativity to resolve longstanding conceptual paradoxes.

    My name is Steven Klemmer and I am an Independent Researcher in Geometry, Physics, and Artificial Intelligence

    I explore connections between geometry, relativity, and cognition, with a focus on hyperbolic embeddings and their applications to the mathematics of consciousness, paradox resolution, and AI behavior. My recent work reframes classical paradoxes (such as Zeno’s approach to infinity) through hyperbolic‑Minkowski embeddings, showing that “infinity” is a dimensional projection artifact rather than an endpoint.

    I publish independently, blending formal LaTeX presentation and peer‑reviewed dissemination with more experimental archives (Zenodo). My research philosophy follows the hacker/outsider lineage: probing systems until hidden structures reveal themselves.
